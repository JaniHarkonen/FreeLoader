# FreeLoader v.0.1.0
FreeLoader allows you to create simple software robots to automate mouse movements and keystrokes. This is the 
initial, very glitchy, version that mainly functions as a test for using Swing and Java Robot.

## Features
- ability to create multiple robots
- robot actions:
  - move/click/hold/release/scroll mouse
  - press/hold/release keys
  - type text
  - run programs
  - non-linear execution of robot actions
  - randomization (action will not be performed the exact same way each time)
